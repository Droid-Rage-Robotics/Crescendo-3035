- Limelight Tracking
        Change Shooter targetVelocity
        Align Drivetrain

- PathPlannerFollow.java and Auto -Lucky: NamedCommands.registerCommand("someOtherCommand", new SomeOtherCommand());

- Robot Tracking on Field
- Field Centric Turning
- Lights: Add lights to have the robot tell us any errors with can, etc; Make LEDs show Errors
- Extension automatically commit any code when pushing code to bot (added it) - need to see if 
- SubsystemCheck Command??
- Fix the PathPlanner Auto Code

URGENT TODO BEFORE COMP: Update to latest WPILib
On ALL Subsystems:
- Have the 2 commands and one protected
- Positions/Velocity
- Min/Max Position
- Check FeedForward/PID calculations

Non Urget ToDos:
FIX the Motors in same file from having hte same shuffle board names
Fix AutoChooser
Make and extended Subsystems to have protected instead of private
What does the Driver.getGameSpecificMessage()?
Add lights to have the robot tell us any errors with can, etc.

Test:
- Limelight AutoAim.java
- Make all of the writes that are not necessary during a match be in a practice only writers (Helps prevent the likelihood of loop overruns)
- Limit Switch to the Intake

Done:
April Tag - https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2023/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2023/subsystems/apriltagvision/AprilTagVision.java#L38 (kind of)

Extra Ideas:
- Lights: Add lights to have the robot tell us any errors with can, etc; Make LEDs show Errors



Simple Changes:
Force Motor Implementation of Direction and coast/brake
Have subsystems go through to get parameters
Finish Kraken Drive/Neo Turn
Test Music
